## Getting Started
User acknowledges instructions from the instructional game popup by pressing "Roger ma'am."  User clicks the upper, green grid looking for enemy ships.  If they hit one, the square will glow red.  Otherwise, the square will be marked with 'O's.  Once all squares of a single enemy ship are hit, the squares will turn dark gray, marked with gray 'X's.  After each user's guess, the enemy (computer) will attempt to guess a square on the user's board as well in hopes of sinking a ship.  The first one to fill their opponent's graveyard and sink all four ships wins.  The User will then have the option to play again or quit.

## Future Features
1. A loading animation while the computer "thinks" of its next move.
2. The ability for a user to position their own ships.
